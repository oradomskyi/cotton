The name "Cotton"(Хлóпок) came after terrorist state mass media prohibited the usage of words such as "explosion" or "fire". So a disaster in their armed forces coming from those who are fighting back against the regime is described as "pop and smoke"("хлопóк и задымление") while meaning literally defeat.

The image of a Cotton plant became a symbol of resistance and victory for us.

Async network stresser.

Developers are not responsible for any kind of damage it may cause, use for your own responsibility.

Good luck!
